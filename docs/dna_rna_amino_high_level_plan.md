# High-Level Plan for Implementing the Code

## 1. **Define Constants**
   - Create sets for valid bases: DNA, RNA, and Amino Acids.
   - These sets will be used to validate and classify sequences.

   **Tasks:**
   - Declare `DNA_BASES`, `RNA_BASES`, and `AMINO_ACIDS`.

---

## 2. **Develop Helper Functions**
   - Implement modular, reusable functions for sequence validation, classification, and counting.

   **Tasks:**
   - Write `contains_no_spaces` to check for spaces in a sequence.
   - Write `is_valid_sequence` to validate a sequence against a set of valid bases.
   - Write `get_sequence_type` to determine if a sequence is DNA, RNA, Amino Acid, or Invalid.
   - Write `count_bases` to count occurrences of unique bases in a sequence.

---

## 3. **Create the Main Function**
   - Process input sequences to classify, validate, and derive relevant information.
   - Include error handling for invalid or improperly formatted sequences.

   **Tasks:**
   - Convert sequence to uppercase.
   - Check for spaces and return an error if found.
   - Identify the sequence type (DNA, RNA, or Amino Acid).
   - Perform sequence-specific operations:
     - For DNA: Convert to RNA.
     - For RNA: Convert to cDNA.
     - For Amino Acids: Indicate detection.
   - Count and display bases or amino acids in the sequence.

---

## 4. **Develop Testing Block**
   - Test the main function with a variety of input sequences to ensure correctness and robustness.

   **Tasks:**
   - Provide example sequences for DNA, RNA, Amino Acids, and invalid cases.
   - Print the results of processing each sequence.

---

## 5. **Integrate Error Handling**
   - Ensure the program handles unexpected inputs.

   **Tasks:**
   - Handle empty sequences.
   - Detect invalid characters or mixed DNA/RNA bases.
